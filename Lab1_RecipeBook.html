<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Season beef with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a heavy pot over high heat.
    Cook and stir beef in hot oil until browned, 5 to 8 minutes.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 :</strong> Stir garlic, vinegar, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, thyme, rosemary, 1 teaspoon black pepper, bay leaf, and
    red pepper flakes into beef. Pour enough chicken broth into beef mixture to cover the meat by 1 inch and bring to a simmer.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 :</strong> Cover pot with a lid, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is fork-tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 :</strong> Transfer meat with a strainer or slotted spoon to a separate pot; pour about 1/4 cup of meat broth into pot.
    Use a wooden spoon to gently break meat into smaller chunks. Cover pot with a lid or aluminum foil and keep warm.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5 :</strong> Skim excess grease from top of broth remaining in the first pot; season with salt and pepper to taste.
    Cover pot with a lid or aluminum foil and keep broth warm.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6 :</strong> Lay halves of a roll out on a work surface and spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons meat broth over each half.
    Top bottom half of roll with a generous portion of meat and a spoonful of pickled vegetables. Place tops on sandwich.
    Repeat with remaining buns, broth, meat, and pickled vegetables to make 3 more sandwiches.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7 :</strong> Spoon hot meat broth into ramekins and top each ramekin with 1/2 teaspoon parsley.
    Serve sandwiches with hot broth for dipping.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 : </strong>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.
    Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning,
    1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 : </strong>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water
    for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,
    remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 : </strong>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 : </strong>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange
    6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella
    cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers,
    and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray,
    or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5 :</strong>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes.
    Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 : </strong>Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of flour over the butter and mix it together with your hands in a
    mixing bowl or on a work surface. Transfer the butter to a length of foil or parchment paper and pat it into a 6 inch square.
    Fold up the foil to make a packet and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 : </strong>Combine 2 cups of the flour with the salt and sugar in a mixing bowl. Dissolve the yeast in the
    lukewarm water (100 degrees F/38 degrees C) and set aside until frothy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, warm the milk and the heavy
    cream to lukewarm. Add the yeast, milk, and cream to the flour mixture and stir well. The dough will have a batter-like
    consistency.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 : </strong>Stir in the remaining 2 cups of flour 1/4 cup at a time to form a soft dough.
    It should no longer be sticky. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes.
    Place the dough in a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 : </strong>To begin the rolling and folding process, both the butter and the dough should be at a cool room
    temperature. [See Cook's Note.] Place the dough on a floured surface and roll it into a 10-inch square. Set the block of butter
    diagonally on the square dough. Bring each point of dough to the center of the butter square; the edges of the dough should
    overlap. Pinch the edges together to seal.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5 : </strong>Starting from the center of the square and working outward, use a rolling pin to roll the dough
    out into a rectangle. The butter should be pliable enough to roll smoothly with the dough; if it's too soft and starts
    to ooze out the corners, wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate before proceeding. Roll the dough into a long
    rectangle, approximately 8 by 18 inches. Fold the length of dough into thirds, like a business letter.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6 : </strong>If the dough is still cool, you can continue with another fold. Otherwise, wrap it in
    plastic and refrigerate for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it warm up for about
    10 minutes before you begin rolling it out again.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7 : </strong>Position the dough so that the open ends are at 12 and 6 o'clock. Roll the dough into a rectangle,
    working from the center of the dough and pressing outwards. Reposition the dough as necessary to fit your work space.
    You should have a long rectangle for the "book fold." Fold both ends of the dough into the middle; the ends don't have
    to be touching, but should be close. Fold the already-folded dough in half; it will look like a thick book. Wrap the
    dough well with plastic and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8 : </strong>Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes.
    Roll the dough into a rectangle again and fold it into thirds, like a business letter. Wrap it in plastic and refrigerate
    for 4-6 hours or overnight.</p>

<p><strong>Step 9 : </strong>To shape the croissants, roll the dough into a 10- by 38-inch rectangle on a lightly floured work surface.
    It should be about 1/4 inch thick. Use a pizza wheel or sharp paring knife to trim the edges of the dough. Divide the rectangle
    in half so that you have two 5-inch wide strips of dough. Use a clean yardstick to mark each strip into triangles that are 5
    inches wide at their bases. Cut the triangles and place them onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Chill for 15 to 20 minutes,
    if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Step 10 : </strong>Starting at the base of the triangle, roll the dough up into a log; the tip of the triangle
    should be under the body of the croissant to prevent it from unraveling. Bend in the corners to form the traditional crescent
    shape. Repeat with the remaining dough.</p>

<p><strong>Step 11 : </strong>Arrange the croissants on the parchment-lined baking
    sheets and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Step 12 : </strong>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Beat the egg with
    the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash. Brush the croissants with egg wash and bake in the preheated
    oven until deep brown, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool on a rack before serving.</p>
